Requirements:
- You must provide your own valkey-benchmark and valkey-cli binaries, which you can obtain from the Valkey project.
- amz_valkey-benchmark is a fork that belongs to Amazon. It is used here to sequentially load all keys in the keyspace to be used.
- recent version of Python 3
- `pip install numerize` (short human-readable numbers)


Use:
Have ssh access to a separate machine for building and running the Valkey server. I use a .pem keyfile to authenticate.
You have to edit the source to configure tests, but it shouldn't be awful. I've been too lazy to make an interface. ü§∑
